# Project: Knights Travails

### Introduction
This projects purpose is to find the shortest path that a Knight can take between two spaces on a chess board. The complete problem can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails

This solution uses Breadth-First traversal to keep track of the path and then returns that path once the correct coordinate is encountered.
