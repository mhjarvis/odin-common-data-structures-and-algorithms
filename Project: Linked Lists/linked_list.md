## Linked Lists

Linked Lists function similar to arrays. The main benefit comes from the ability to easily insert/remove elements into the list without the need to reallocaate any other elements.

## Structure of a Linked List
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point” to the next node by means of a pointer.

Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node in the list.

A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last node in the list. Below is a basic representation of a linked list:

    [ NODE(head) ] -> [ NODE ] -> [ NODE(tail) ] -> null
